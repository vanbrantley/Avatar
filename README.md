## Overview

Avatar is a web application that you can use to manage your wardrobe.

Add garments that you own to your digital closet and preview different outfit combinations on your Avatar.

Identify colors that would integrate well into your wardrobe so you know what pieces you should buy next.

## Walkthrough

<!-- [[ Avatar Demo YouTube video (eventually) ]] -->

![Closet Mode](public/closet-mode.png)

The Avatar character is made up of 5 different areas (hat, face, top, bottom, shoe), each of which you can assign the color of.

Click an area on the Avatar to make it the selected area.

Use the color picker and color swatches to change the color of the selected area.

### Modes

Avatar has three different modes: **Lab**, **Closet**, and **Mockup**.
